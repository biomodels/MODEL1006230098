# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Macrophage dynamics in diabetic wound dealing.**   
Waugh HV, Sherratt JA. _Bull Math Biol_ 2006 Jan;68(1):197-207
[16794927](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16794927) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Wound healing in diabetes is a complex process, characterised by a chronic
inflammation phase. The exact mechanism by which this occurs is not fully
understood, and whilst several treatments for healing diabetic wounds exist,
very little research has been conducted towards the causes of the extended
inflammation phase. We describe a mathematical model which offers a possible
explanation for diabetic wound healing in terms of the distribution of
macrophage phenotypes being altered in the diabetic patient compared to normal
wound repair. As a consequence of this, we put forward a suggestion for
treatment based on rectifying the macrophage phenotype imbalance.

This model was taken from the [CellML
repository](http://www.cellml.org/models) and automatically converted to SBML.
